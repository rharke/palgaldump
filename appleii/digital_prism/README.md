# Applied Engineering Digital Prism

These are reverse-engineered dumps of the two PALs on Applied Engineering's family of RGB piggyback cards for the RamWorks.

The AERGB PAL is present on the original RGB Card as well as the Digital Prism and the Color Link.

The AEDP PAL is present on the Digital Prism and the Color Link.

The originals are PAL16L8 chips, but I have successfully replaced them with ATF16V8B chips using this code, and functionality appears identical.
